##  Project 1: Maze Solver using A* Search Algorithm

### 🔹 Description
This project implements a Maze Solver using the **A* (A-Star) Search Algorithm**.  
The maze is represented as a 2D grid where:
- `0` represents a free path  
- `1` represents a wall  

The A* algorithm uses a heuristic (Manhattan Distance) to find the **shortest path** from a start point to a goal point.

### 🔹 Algorithm Used
- A* Search Algorithm  
- Manhattan Distance Heuristic  

### 🔹 Tools Used
- Python  
- heapq (Priority Queue)

### 🔹 File
- `maze_solver.py`

### 🔹 Output
- Displays the shortest path from start to goal  
- Handles unreachable path cases

##  Project 2: Rule-Based Expert System using Forward Chaining

### 🔹 Description
This project implements a **Rule-Based Expert System** using **Forward Chaining**.  
The system accepts user-provided facts (symptoms), applies IF–THEN rules, and infers conclusions step by step while logging the reasoning process.

### 🔹 AI Concept Used
- Rule-Based Expert System  
- Forward Chaining Inference  

### 🔹 Features
- Knowledge base with IF–THEN rules  
- Facts base from user input  
- Multi-step inference  
- Reasoning steps displayed  

### 🔹 Tools Used
- Python  

### 🔹 File
- `expert_system.py`

### 🔹 Sample Input
